% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Since the arise of agile software development methods efficient communication has been taken seriously in the software projects. The agile methods emphasis intense communication between customer and development organization instead of exchanging documents. Communication plays a big role in the software projects of today. In various researches it has been shown that effective communication is a primary key to successful project (LÄHDE LÄHDE). 

One important part of the communication is the feedback the customer provides to the development organization. Feedback enables customer to control the project and direct the development organization to correct route. The lack of feedback or slow feedback cycle may result as undesired outcomes.

This paper investigates the communication between customer and the development organization having a focus on the feedback communication. Strong emphasis is put in inspecting the different methods of feedback communication and investigating how these methods can be used effectively. At the end of the paper a new feedback tool Hannotaatio is going to be introduced. 

% Why is the customer feedback important?

\section{Definition of customer feedback}

% Three phases of communication
% Before-, mid-, end-communication

Customer feedback is a part of the communication between the customer and the development organization during the software project. To be able to give feedback the customer obviously has to have something (eg. a design document or a piece of working software) from which she can give the feedback. Thus, the feedback communication can take place only after the development or design process has already started.

In agile software development the software project is devided into iterations. In each iteration, various communication phases occur at various stages of the iteration. According to Bhalerao these communication phases consist of primary, mid and end phases \cite{2010bhalerao}.

Bhalerao states, that feedback involves in the end iteration. Primary phase communication deals with information gathering and happens in the early phase of the iteration. Mid phase communication takes place after the initial task gathering and priorization when the development team is implementing the iteration tasks. At this stage, technical communication is involved. \cite{2010bhalerao}

In this paper feedback is not considered to be given only in the end phase of iteration. In agile context, teams are encouraged to utilize continuous integration principle (LÄHDE!). Continuous integration allows the customer to always have access to the latest version of the software or at least once per day if nightly builds are used instead (LÄHDE!). Thus, it is most likely that customer will give feedback to the team also in the mid phase of the iteration. This is also encouraged to provide a rapid feedback cycle.

\section{Importance of feedback}

\textbf{TODO:} Why is feedback important? Why efficient feedback methods are important?

\section{Existing theories behind communication methods}

\subsection{Media richness theory}

Daft et. al. have proposed a theory of media richness \cite{1986daft}. Media richness theory (MRT) is well-known and largely used even though it has been widely criticized \cite{2006korkala} \cite{1999dennis}. 

According to MRT the different communication methods can be ranked based on their "richness". Daft et. al. defines the richness as the ability of information to change understanding within a time interval. The richness is derived from the capacity of immediate feedback, the number of cues and channels utilized, personalization and language variety. Daft et. al. lists the following media classifications in order of decreasing richness: face-to-face communication, telephone, personal documents, impersonal written documents and numberic documents \cite{1986daft}. To this list Korkala et. al. have added video conference and email among others \cite{2006korkala}. The richness of video conference is between face-to-face and telephone while the richness of emails goes to same category as personal documents.

Media richness theory utilizes concepts of uncertainty and equivocality. Uncertainty exists if a information can be interpreted unambiguously but is a lack of information. Equivocality exists when there are multiple and possibly conflicting interpretations although the amount of information is sufficient. As equivocality rises a greater amount of negotiations is required to reach a consensus on one interpretation. \cite{1999dennis}

MRT argues that a certain communication media are more suitable for certain tasks. A richer media is preferred for high equivocal task while leaner media are suitable for tasks with low equivocality. \cite{1999dennis}

In iterative software development various communication phases occur in an iteration. According to Bhalerao these phases are primary, mid- and end-iteration phases. \cite{2010bhalerao}

The primary phases consist of planning tasks. Before the feature implementation, the development team and the customer have to form a shared understanding of what will be implemented. As the consensus is formed it is agreed or documented as a specification for the implementation. In this phase high uncertainty and high equivocality exists. 

In the mid-iteration phase the implementation of the agreed features for the iteration has started. Mid-iteration communication consist of corrective questions regarding the specification. Uncertainty is high while equivocality is low since the high-level consensus has been formed in the previous phase. As the development team starts delivering implemented features feedback communication takes place.

The end-iteration communication consist of feedback communication. The primary task in this phase is to validate the implemtented features. The main method for validation is an iteration demo and customer feedback.

The feedback the customer gives can be unambigious. When a developer interprets the feedback received from customer multiple questions may arise: Are we talking about the same part of the software? Why is this a problem in the first place? How it should be fixed?

Since the feedback can be unambigous and difficult to interpret it can be argued that high equivocality involves in feedback communication. According to media richness theory rich communication methods should be used in feedback communication. Also Bhalerao suggegests the same by arguing that face-to-face communication is the preferred mode for feedback communication for instant feedback \cite{2010bhalerao}. 

\subsection{Media synchronicity theory}

Dennis and Valacich have criticized MRT for various reasons. First, empirical research of media richness theory have not been convincing. Second, empirical studies have shown that the media actually used for different communication tasks does not match with the media richness theory. Korkala et. al. achieved the same result as they noticed email was commonly used communication practise even though "richer" communication methods were encouraged \cite{2006korkala}. Third, Dennis and Valacich argue that in contrarily to MRT, one can not rank communication methods to "rich" and "poor". \cite{1999dennis}

\textbf{TODO:} Esittele conveyance ja convergence

Dennis and Valacich formed a list of five media characteristics that can affect communication. The characteristics are transmission velocity (also known as immediacy of feedback \cite{1999dennis}, parallelism, symbol sets, rehearsability and reprocessability. They evaluated various communication methods from face-to-face discussions to written documents based on the five characteristics. The result of the evaluation was that methods can not be ranked from "best" to "worst", or from "richest" to "poorest" \cite{2008dennis}. 

The transmission velocity describes the speed at which medium is capable of transmitting the message to recipient. \cite{dennis2008}. From feedback point-of-view, transmission velocity is important but not as important as it is for e.g. planning tasks. For example, communication context for planning is novel where as feedback is given in a context where feedback sender and receiver are familiar with the subject. When the context is familiar 

\section{Current communication methods for giving and receiving feedback}

\textbf{TODO:} Synchronous (face-to-face) vs. asynchonous methods (almost all the other)

\textbf{TODO:} Same physical location vs. different physical location

\subsection{Face-to-face}

Methods for giving feedback vary from document sharing to face-to-face conversation. In agile context tight customer collaboration is emphasised and the preferred communication method is face-to-face conversation. Extreme Programming (XP) even demanded an on-site customer to enable rapid feedback and high-bandwidth communication between customer and the development team \cite{2002wake}. % Wake page 1, lol

In Scrum, on-site customer is not mandatory (LÄHDE). When customer is off-site, the communication methods in the mid iteration falls back to email and phone, as Bhalerao states \cite{2010bhalerao}. The face-to-face feedback is given at the end of the iteration in the iteration demo session.

Bhalerao states that feedback communication should be done face-to-face \cite{2010bhalerao}. Also Korkala et. al. underlines the importance of face-to-face communication by arguing that it should be the default communication method in agile development. However, to provide both rapid feedback cycle and face-to-face feedback the customer has to be on-site. If the customer is off-site but the rapid feedback cycle is wanted to be preserved, other feedback methods than face-to-face have to be exercised. 

% Käytä tätä KORKALA: 
% Since the customer is not any longer required for fulltime presence, the already important roles of communication and feedback become even more essential. Thus it is essential that the communication and feedback mechanisms should receive special attention in agile development.

\subsection{Other methods}

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
