% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

\usepackage{verbatim} 




% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Since the arise of agile software development methods efficient customer communication have been taken seriously in software projects. The agile methods emphasize intense communication between customer and development organization instead of exchanging documents. Communication plays a big role in the software projects of today. In previous research it has been shown that lack of communication and customer involvement is one of the biggest chanllenge faced by agile teams \cite{2010hoda}. 

One important part of the communication is the feedback the customer provides to the development organization. Feedback enables customer to control the project and direct the development organization to the correct route. The lack of feedback or slow feedback cycle may result undesired outcomes.

This paper investigates the communication between customer and the development organization having a focus on the feedback communication. The context is in agile software development. Strong emphasis is put in inspecting the different methods of feedback communication and investigating how these methods can be used effectively. The research question is, what are the most efficient methods to give feedback.

The research methods used in this paper are theorethical based on existing theories and studies. First, based on existing research about customer communication and feedback, the current methods for giving feedback are introduced. Second, these methods are evaluated using two communication media theories, Media Richness Theory (MRT) and Media Synchronicity Theory (MST).

At the end of the paper a new feedback tool Hannotaatio is going to be introduced. Hannotaatio is a visual website feedback tool which allows customer to give visual feedback to the development organisation. Hannotaatio is then evaluated with the two theories, MRT and MST, but no empirical study of it is done in this paper.

\section{Definition of customer feedback}

% Three phases of communication
% Before-, mid-, end-communication

Customer feedback is a part of the communication between the customer and the development organization during the software project. To be able to give feedback the customer obviously has to have something (eg. a design document or a piece of working software) from which she can give the feedback. Thus, the feedback communication can take place only after the development or design process has already started.

Feedback can be given about various aspects of the project. Feedback can be given about working methods, project management, communication practices or the actual output of the effort the development team has conducted. The output of the work effort can be e.g. technical design of the product, a visual design of the product or a piece of working software. This paper consentrates on feedback about \textit{what} the team, not \textit{how} it has done the work. The main focus is on feedback about the working piece of software the team has delivered.

Feedback can be also given from customer or developers themselves. This paper focuses on feedback from customer to the development team. Since the context of the paper is in agile development, by customer we mean product owner.

In agile software development the software project is devided into iterations. In each iteration, various communication phases occur at various stages of the iteration. According to Bhalerao these communication phases consist of primary, mid and end phases \cite{2010bhalerao}.

Bhalerao states, that feedback involves in the end iteration. Primary phase communication deals with information gathering and happens in the early phase of the iteration. Mid phase communication takes place after the initial task gathering and priorization when the development team is implementing the iteration tasks. At this stage, technical communication is involved. \cite{2010bhalerao}

In this paper feedback is not considered to be given only in the end phase of iteration. In agile context, teams are encouraged to utilize continuous integration principle \cite{2002wake}. Continuous integration allows the customer to always have access to the latest version of the software or at least once per day if nightly builds are used instead. Thus, it is most likely that customer will give feedback to the team also in the mid phase of the iteration. This is also encouraged to provide a rapid feedback cycle.

\begin{comment}

\section{Current communication methods for giving and receiving feedback}

The communication methods can be characterized based on the different media capabilities proposed by media richness theory and media synchronicity theory. In addition to these capabilities, the media either synchronous or asynchronous character and they or may not require sharing the same physical location.

In the following chapters various methods for giving and receiving feedback in current agile software projects are investigated.

\textbf{TODO:} Synchronous (face-to-face) vs. asynchonous methods (almost all the other)

\textbf{TODO:} Same physical location vs. different physical location

\subsection{Face-to-face}

Methods for giving feedback vary from document sharing to face-to-face conversation. In agile context tight customer collaboration is emphasised and the preferred communication method is face-to-face conversation. Extreme Programming (XP) even demanded an on-site customer to enable rapid feedback and high-bandwidth communication between customer and the development team \cite{2002wake}. % Wake page 1, lol

In Scrum, on-site customer is not mandatory (LÄHDE). When customer is off-site, the communication methods in the mid iteration falls back to email and phone, as Bhalerao states \cite{2010bhalerao}. The face-to-face feedback is given at the end of the iteration in the iteration demo session.

Bhalerao states that feedback communication should be done face-to-face \cite{2010bhalerao}. Also Korkala et. al. underlines the importance of face-to-face communication by arguing that it should be the default communication method in agile development \cite{2006korkala}.

Despite the advantages of face-to-face communication it is also a costly communication method. Face-to-face communication is synchronous method which requires shared physical location. In software projects where customer is not on-site, other feedback methods than have to be exercised.

% Käytä tätä KORKALA: 
% Since the customer is not any longer required for fulltime presence, the already important roles of communication and feedback become even more essential. Thus it is essential that the communication and feedback mechanisms should receive special attention in agile development.

\section{Research methods}

\subsection{Media richness theory}

Daft et. al. have proposed a theory of media richness \cite{1986daft}. Media richness theory (MRT) is well-known and widely used even though it has been criticized \cite{2006korkala} \cite{1999dennis}. 

According to MRT the different communication methods can be ranked based on their "richness". Daft et. al. defines the richness as the ability of information to change understanding within a time interval. The richness is derived from the capacity of immediate feedback, number of cues and channels utilized, personalization and language variety. Daft et. al. lists the following media classifications in order of decreasing richness: face-to-face communication, telephone, personal documents, impersonal written documents and numberic documents \cite{1986daft}. To this list Korkala et. al. have added video conference and email among others \cite{2006korkala}. The richness of video conference is between face-to-face and telephone while the richness of emails goes to same category as personal documents.

Media richness theory utilizes concepts of uncertainty and equivocality. Uncertainty exists if information can be interpreted unambiguously but there is a lack of information. Equivocality exists when there are multiple and possibly conflicting interpretations although the amount of information is sufficient. As equivocality rises a greater amount of negotiations is required to reach a consensus on one interpretation. \cite{1999dennis}

MRT argues that a certain communication media are more suitable for certain tasks. A richer media is preferred for high equivocal task while leaner media are suitable for tasks with low equivocality. 

\subsection{Media synchronicity theory}

Dennis and Valacich have criticized MRT for various reasons. First, empirical research of media richness theory have not been convincing. Second, empirical studies have shown that the media actually used for different communication tasks does not match with the media richness theory. Korkala et. al. achieved the same result as they noticed email was commonly used communication practise even though "richer" communication methods were encouraged \cite{2006korkala}. Third, Dennis and Valacich argue that in contrarily to MRT, one can not rank communication methods to "rich" and "poor". \cite{1999dennis}

\textbf{TODO:} Esittele conveyance ja convergence

Dennis and Valacich formed a list of five media characteristics that can affect communication. The characteristics are transmission velocity (also known as immediacy of feedback \cite{1999dennis}), parallelism, symbol sets, rehearsability and reprocessability. They evaluated various communication methods from face-to-face discussions to written documents based on the five characteristics. The result of the evaluation was that methods can not be ranked from "best" to "worst", or from "richest" to "poorest" \cite{2008dennis}. 

\section{Results}

Before applying the MRT and MST theories the nature of customer feedback communication has to be defined. In customer feedback communication, customer is the source of information. In most cases the amount of information available from the customer is sufficient for the team to conduct follow up actions. However, in some cases the customer may be unsatisfied but unable to provide necessary feedback for the team to come up with an appropriate solution. It can be stated that the level of information available varies. In terms of media richness theory this means that the level of uncertainty varies but in general it can be stated that the level of uncertainty is medium \cite{1986daft}. 

The development team has to interpret the feedback from customer after receiving it. The feedback from the customer can be ambiguous even if the amount of information available is sufficient. When a developer interprets the feedback received from customer multiple questions may arise: Are we talking about the same part of the software? Why is this a problem in the first place? How it should be fixed? Because of the ambiguous nature of feedback and possibility of conflicting interpretations, in the context of media richness theory this means that feedback communication is affected by equivocality. However, since the customer and the team are having feedback communication around familiar and known subject (the software product) it can be argued that the level of equivocality is not the highest one, instead, medium.

As stated already, feedback communication is held in a context which is familiar to the individuals working with each other. The individuals are most likely used to work with each other and they are familiar with the tasks they are working on and the media they are using for communication. According to media synchronicity theory, in a familiar communication context the emphasis on the communication should be on conveyance process. The theory states that conveyance processes are best served by media with capabilities supporting low synchronicity.

\subsection{Feedback communication according to MRT}

The media richness theory proposes that "richer" communication media are more suitable for tasks with high equivocality where as "leaner" media are more suitable for tasks with low equivolality but high uncertainty. \cite{1999dennis} In the case of feedback communication we fall in the middle.

\begin{comment}
\textbf{TODO: Onko palaute yksiselitteisesti equivocality? MST:n mukaan ollaan hieman toisilla jäljillä}

\textbf{TODO: Lue MRT uudestaan ja koita ymmärtää onko just näin. Lue myös Korkalaa ja Bhaleraoa, jotka ovat käyttäneet ko. teoriaa}

In iterative software development various communication phases occur in an iteration. According to Bhalerao these phases are primary, mid- and end-iteration phases. \cite{2010bhalerao}

The primary phases consist of planning tasks. Before the feature implementation, the development team and the customer have to form a shared understanding of what will be implemented. As the consensus is formed it is agreed or documented as a specification for the implementation. In this phase high uncertainty and high equivocality exists. 

In the mid-iteration phase the implementation of the agreed features for the iteration has started. Mid-iteration communication consist of corrective questions regarding the specification. Uncertainty is high while equivocality is low since the high-level consensus has been formed in the previous phase. As the development team starts delivering implemented features feedback communication takes place.

The end-iteration communication consist of feedback communication. The primary task in this phase is to validate the implemtented features. The main method for validation is an iteration demo and customer feedback.

The feedback the customer gives can be unambigious. When a developer interprets the feedback received from customer multiple questions may arise: Are we talking about the same part of the software? Why is this a problem in the first place? How it should be fixed?

Since the feedback can be unambigous and difficult to interpret it can be argued that high equivocality involves in feedback communication. According to media richness theory rich communication methods should be used in feedback communication. Also Bhalerao suggegests the same by arguing that face-to-face communication is the preferred mode for feedback communication for instant feedback \cite{2010bhalerao}.

\end{comment}

\subsection{Feedback communication according to MST}

As stated earlier, feedback communication is best served by media with capabilities supporting low synchronicity. According to media synchronicity theory, the five media capabilities have different capabilities to support synchronicity. Evaluating these capabilities in the context of feedback it can be seen what kind of capabilities an effective feedback method has.

Transmission velocity is the speed at which medium is capable of transmitting the message to recipient. From feedback point-of-view, transmission velocity is important but not as important as it is for e.g. planning tasks. For example, communication context for planning is novel where as feedback is given in a context where feedback sender and receiver are familiar with the subject. When the context is familiar conveyance should be emphasized. To support conveyance a communication method with lower synchronicity level should result in better communication performance. High transmission velocity supports synchronicity, thus in conclusion, for feedback purposes where conveyance process is emphasized, communication method with lower transmission velocity should be used according to Dennis et. al. \cite{2008dennis}

Parallelism describes the medium's capability for multipe parallel communication sessions \cite{2008dennis}. Synchronous communication methods such as face-to-face communication and telephone support poorly parallelism where as asynchorous computer-aided methods such as chat rooms and emails support parallelism well. Parallelism has negative impact on media synchronocity. Thus, media with high parallelism should be used for feedback purposes. \cite{2008dennis}

Symbol set describes the number of ways in which a medium allows information to be encoded for communication \cite{2008dennis}. For example face-to-face communication has a higher number of symbol sets than written document since face-to-face communication can transfer also vocal tones and physical gestures. Symbol sets can be natural (physical, visual, verbal) or less natural (written or typed). More natural symbol sets support higher synchronocity, however, using a medium with a symbol set better suited to the content of message will improve information transmission and processing \cite{2008dennis}. For feedback this means that a verbal description of a activity on a Web site can be less effective than a visual demonstration and a verbal description or a series of annotated screen shots with a written description \cite{2008dennis}.

Rehearability stands for the ability to fine tune the message before sending it. High rehearsability reduces possibilities to misunderstandings as the sender can carefully fine tune the message to describe exactly what she means to. However, rehearsability adds delays to the conversation. \cite{2008dennis} 

From the viewpoint of feedback, reharsability is important. An unthoughtful comment from customer about an implemented feature may give a wrong impression to the developer who may end up doing a change that the customer did not actually intended from the first place. In addition, giving a negative feedback to the development team in an unthoughtful way may reduce developers' motivation.

Reprocessability describes the posibility to reprocess the transmitted message. The ability to reread the message increases the understanding of the content, but adds delays to the conversation. \cite{2008dennis}

The understanding of the feedback given by the customer increases if the developer can reprocess the feedback. This is especially true if the message is communication via a medium which does not support symbol set suited to the content of the message. 

In many occasions the received feedback requires for actions. The required action may not be executed immediately. If for example a developer makes a change based on the customer feedback after a couple of days of receiving the feedback, the reprocessability plays a great role.

In conclusion, feedback is given in a context which is familiar to the individuals working with each other, thus moving the emphasis from convergence process to conveyance process. According to MST conveyance processes are best served by media with capabilities supporting low synchronicity. Media with low synchronocity are for example documents, fax, voice mail, asynchonous electronic mail (email) and asynchronous electronic conferencing. \cite{2008dennis}

NOPEA PÄÄTELMÄ: 
MST: Feedback: 

Contexti: Familiar, käytännössä siis: high conveyance, low convergence ==> less synchronicity

P1: Lower synchronicity
P2: Trasmission velocity improves synchronicity -> Lower transmission velovity
P3: Parallelism lower synchronicity -> High parallelism
P4(a): Natural symbols support synchronicity -> Use unnatural symbols
P4(b): Symbols better suited to content support synchronicity -> Use ill suited symbols
P5: Rehearsability lowers synchronicity -> High rehearsability
P6: Reproducability lowers synch -> High reproducability

--> 

lower transmission velocity, high parallelism, reharsability is important, high reprocessability -> Elektoriseen muotoon

\section{Discussion}

According to both media richness theory and media synchronicity theory, face-to-face communication is not the most efficient feedback communication method. Instead, "leaner" methods or methods with lower support for synchronicity should be used.

The result is in contrast to some previus researches and what the agile manifesto proposes. One of the twelve principles of the agile manifesto states that "the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation." \cite{agilemanifesto} In addition, Bhalerao states that at the end of the iteration when customer feedback is given, active communication methods should be utilized. By active communication methods Bhalerao means face-to-face communication or telephone communication \cite{2010bhalerao}
